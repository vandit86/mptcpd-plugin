This directory contains copies of the <linux/mptcp.h> header in the
upstream Linux kernel, as well as the multipath-tcp.org kernel.  They
are only used if the mptcpd `configure' script doesn't detect them.
Mptcpd supports the MPTCP path management generic netlink APIs defined
in both headers, and refers to the upstream kernel header as
"mptcp_upstream.h", and the multipath-tcp.org header as
"mptcp_org.h".

The licensing terms for both headers is the same as their in-kernel
source tree counterparts.
